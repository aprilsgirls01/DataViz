Globe  explanation (written by Emma Carlson, 2018):

The globe is a simple tool that overlays text on an image of a globe. 
This is intended to be a visually more interesting way to present a data touchdown (see Gallup's static graphic generation tool, a type of infographic)
It has not been worked on beyond the initial phase of this project, and so, it has very low functionality. 
Next steps on this project would be formatting it to be more visually appealing, as well as making it compliant with Gallup's style guide.
