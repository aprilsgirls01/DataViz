Scatter Plot explanation (written by Emma Carlson, 2018):

The code for this tool has been taken from: https://canvasjs.com/docs/charts/how-to/render-chart-by-accepting-datapoints-from-user-input/
This was a tool that we had begun work on, but never finished. It is barely modified. To use this graph, an x and y vaule are inserted and the chart
is rendered when the button is pressed. The dots are diffrent colors, cycling through. This is an issue that needs to be fixed, but we did not have the time
to play with code.

This tool has been written with the chart.js library
