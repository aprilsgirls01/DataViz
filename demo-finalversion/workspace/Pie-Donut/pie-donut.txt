Pie/Donut explanation (written by Emma Carlson, 2018):

The pie/donut chart is based on the google charts example, which can be found here: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/piechart
The input boxes labeled percentages are used to render the chart. Each is assoicated with a different color and the data can be inserted in a variety of ways. 
It is important to know that the percentages are not actual percentages. 
The total value of the inputs is added up by google charts and each slice is what percentage of the total the individual input is. 
The pie chart can be rendered in 3D, using the radio button. The 3D rendering will override the pie hole value (a donut chart cannot be 3D). 
A pie hole is used to create a donut chart, and can range from 10% to 90%, for simplicity's sake, I have made these whole numbers (1-9). 
Any number higher or lower than 1-9 will result in no hole.
