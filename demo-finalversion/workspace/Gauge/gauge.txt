Bar Chart explanation (written by Emma Carlson, 2018):

The guage is a fairly simple tool. It is created using the Google Charts js library.
It has two input boxes, one for label on the guage and another for the value. That input is submitted to the draw guage function. 
The size and color of the guage can be set by changing the variables under options. 
fromGreen and toGreen set how large the green segment will be. The other colors can be set by using the same format, with green subsitued for the color.
Defining the color outside of the scale set for the guage or leaving one of the variables undefined could change the appearence of the guage.
