Multigraph explanation (written by Emma Carlson, 2018):

This is a graph that can be found in Google charts library: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/combochart
A table is used for inputs, the boxes in the country rows are for the bar graph and the row labeled average is used for rendering the line.
The x and y axis can be given names using the form, and title and subtitle can be provided. Only the row labeled month must have content for the chart to render.
Not all months must be used, but the months with input must start with the first box.
