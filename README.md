# DataViz

Explanation written by Emma C. (2018)

This project contains our work on the data visualization project. 
There are text files accompanying each gaphic tool.
These provide some explanation of the tool and it's functionality and contain the licenses to which each tool is subject.
For more clarification or help, please contact me at aprilsgirls01@gmail.com.
I am happy to help anyway that I can, even after the end of our time here at Gallup.
